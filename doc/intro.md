# Introduction

We have provided several examples to demonstrate the capabilities of the library.

> You can find them in the [README](../README.md)

All you need to do is writing a declaration for the class which needs to be reflected.

The declaration is simple enough that we don't need any marco to simplify it. **We also provide a parser to auto
generate the declaration file**.

The library is well-designed so it's very tiny (only 99 lines), so it's easy to get the whole idea of this
library. [MySRefl_99.h](../include/MySRefl_99.h) is condensed from  [MySRefl.h](../include/MySRefl/MySRefl.h) which is
much easier to read. Both of them have the same API.

## 1. Design

The library is noninvasive and static.

We have provided several template classes to support the reflection, including

- `template<typename T> NamedValue`: a **value** with a **name** (if value's type `T` is `void`, it means this object
  has no value but a name).
- `template<typename... Elems> ElemList`: element list, the elements' types `Elems...` can be attributes, fields, type
  information or bases. It is a base class of their list. Actually, it's a `std::tuple`.
- `template<typename T> Attr`: a field may have some attributes (key + value), value's type is `T`ï¼Œit can be `void`.
- `template<typename T, typename AList> Field`: a field is a named value with an attribute list. The value's type is
  `T`,
  it can be (non-)static member variable/function pointer or a key of an enum.
- `template<typename T> TypeInfo`: this template class is the only part you need to write. You should be partial
  specialization it and write some static information of the type `T` you need to reflect. You can read the example
  codes to see how it is declared easily.
- `template<typename T, bool IsVirtual=false> Base`: a template class to tag a base type `T` of the type which you're
  declaring. the template arguments `bool IsVirtual` is for the virtual inheritance.
- list: there are some template list class which are derived from `ElemList`, has several functions for searching,
  accumulating and so on.
    - `template<typename... Attrs> AttrList`: attribute list, `Attrs...` are attribute types `Attr`.
    - `template<typename... Fields> FieldList`: field list, `Fields...` are field types `Field`.
    - `template<typename... Bases> BaseList`: base list, `Bases` are base tag types `Base`.
- `template<typename T, typename... Bases> TypeInfoBase`: a helper template class for the declaration of type `T`. It
  provides some functions and a base list for the type `T`.

Here is a brief summary

- `Attr`: name [+ value]
- `Field`: name + value + attribute list
- `TypeInfo`: TypeInfoBase ( bases ) + name + field list + attribute list
- `Base`: type + `IsVirtual`
- list: `ElemList` -> `AttrList`, `FieldList`, `BaseList`

## 2. Example

Suppose that the type `Point` is need to be reflected.

 ```c++
 struct [[size(8)]] Point {
   [[not_serialize]]
   float x;
   [[info("hello")]]
   float y;
 };
 ```

`[[...]]` are attributes, but they are useless in the code, so they act like comments.

Then we need to write a declaration for it.

 ```c++
 template<>
 struct TypeInfo<Point> : TypeInfoBase<Point> {
   // the name is declared by TypeInfoBase<Point>
   // if you use MySRefl_99.h, you should declare it here.
   // static constexpr std::string_view name = "struct Point";
 
   static constexpr FieldList fields = {
     Field{"x", &Point::x, AttrList{ Attr{ "not_serialize" } }},
     Field{"y", &Point::y, AttrList{ Attr{ "info", "hello" } }}
   };
 
   static constexpr AttrList attrs = {
     Attr{ "size", 8 }
   };
 };
 ```

The important points are

- `TypeInfoBase<Point>`
- `name`
- `fields`
- `attrs`

It's easy to write if you are familiar how it is declared.

Then you can write some code with the reflection.

**iterate fields and attrs of fields**

 ```c++
 TypeInfo<Point>::fields.ForEach([](auto field) {
   cout << field.name << endl;
   field.attrs.ForEach([](auto attr) {
     cout << attr.name;
     if constexpr (attr.has_value)
       cout << ": " << attr.value;
     cout << endl;
   });
 });
 ```

**query**

 ```c++
 static_assert(TypeInfo<Point>::fields.Contains("x"));
 ```

**iterate attrs of the type**

 ```c++
 TypeInfo<Point>::attrs.ForEach([](auto attr) {
   cout << attr.name;
   if constexpr (!attr.has_value)
     cout << ": " << attr.value;
   cout << endl;
 });
 ```

**iterate member variables of an object**

 ```c++
 TypeInfo<Point>::ForEachVarOf(Point{ 1,2 }, [](auto field, auto&& var) {
   cout << field.name << " : " << var << endl;
 });
 ```
